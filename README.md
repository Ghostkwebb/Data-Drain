    -   **Video**: Download in `MP4`, `MKV`, `MOV`, or `AVI`.
    -   **Audio**: Extract audio-only streams to `MP3`, `FLAC`, `WAV`, or `M4A`.
-   **QuickTime Optimization**: The `MP4` option automatically re-encodes the video to the H.264 codec, ensuring perfect compatibility with QuickTime and other Apple devices.
-   **Real-time Progress Reporting**:
    -   A live progress bar tracks download percentage.
    -   The download button dynamically updates its text (`Downloading... 52%`).
    -   **Explicit FFmpeg Status**: Clearly indicates when `ffmpeg` is processing, merging, or re-encoding files so you know the app isn't frozen.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/)
-   `yt-dlp` (Command-line tool)
-   `ffmpeg` (Command-line tool)

**On macOS (via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)):**
```bash
brew install python yt-dlp ffmpeg
```
**On Windows (via [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/)):**
```bash
# Using Chocolatey
choco install python ffmpeg yt-dlp

# Using Scoop
scoop install python ffmpeg yt-dlp
```

### 2. Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows

# Install the required Python libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(You will need to create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:)*
```txt
requests
Pillow
pyinstaller
```

### 3. Running the Script
With your virtual environment activated, simply run:
```bash
python3 youtube_downloader_pro_final.py
```

### 4. Packaging the Application

#### macOS Build (`.app`)

```bash
# 1. Build the app, bundling yt-dlp and ffmpeg
pyinstaller --name "DataDrain" \
            --windowed \
            --icon "icon.icns" \
            --add-binary "/opt/homebrew/bin/yt-dlp:." \
            --add-binary "/opt/homebrew/bin/ffmpeg:." \
            youtube_downloader_pro_final.py
